# Working folder (`WORK_DIR` → `/work`)

Every Enclave deployment answers one question explicitly: **where does the agent's work actually get
saved, and how does it stay searchable?** Two mounts, two jobs:

| Mount | In-container | Role |
|-------|-------------|------|
| `./home` | `/agent` | The agent's **brain** — `CLAUDE.md`, `memory/`, `skills/`, `inbox.md`, `work.json`, `state/`, `logs/`. A scan-gated git vault. |
| `WORK_DIR` | `/work` | The **project working folder** — the real tree the agent operates on and saves output into (rw). |

Keep them separate: the brain is *how* the agent thinks; the working folder is *what* it works on.

## Configure it

In `.env`:

```sh
WORK_DIR=/Users/you/Dev/your-project    # host path → mounted rw at /work
```

- **Blank / unset** → defaults to `./home/work` (a folder inside the vault). Fine for a self-contained
  agent that just produces documents.
- **A host path** → that real tree *becomes* the agent's working folder. The agent and you see the
  same files; its writes land on the host immediately.

`enclave init` prompts for this (`--work-dir /abs/path` non-interactively) and writes it to `.env`.
Changing it later: edit `.env`, then `docker compose up -d` to recreate the agent with the new mount.

## What the agent can and can't do in `/work`

- **Write / edit files** — yes. Saves persist to the host bind mount instantly. No commit needed for
  the file to exist on disk.
- **`git`** — no. The guard blocks `git` for agents (see `SECURITY.md`); the operator owns commits.
  This is intentional: the agent's writes survive on their own, and you stay in control of history.
- **Read** — yes, the whole tree, unless your secrets hygiene says otherwise (the working tree is the
  agent's, but it's still subject to the guard's foreign-secrets block for `.secrets/`-style paths).

> ⚠ **Mounting a real repo rw exposes whatever is in it to the agent process** — including any
> credentials checked into that tree. That's a property of the repo, not Enclave. If the tree holds
> live secrets, treat the deployment as trusted, scrub the tree, or use a read-only reference mount
> plus a separate writable output folder instead.

## Continuous indexing (fresh recall)

Saved work is only useful if the agent can find it again. Index `/work` so new and changed files
become searchable:

- **Host qmd gateway (this deployment's pattern):** the working tree is registered as one or more
  collections in `~/.config/qmd/index.yml`, and a launchd timer (`org.qmd.reembed`, every 15 min)
  runs `qmd update && qmd embed` to re-embed changes incrementally. The agent reaches it through the
  scoped gateway in `home/.mcp.json`. New files the agent writes are searchable on the next pass.
  Files in a directory not covered by a collection pattern stay invisible (fail-safe) — extend the
  patterns to index a new area.
- **Containerized qmd (portable):** point the compose `qmd` profile's corpus at `/work` and run
  `QMD_MODE=reembed` on a schedule. See `docs/MEMORY-PROVIDERS.md`.
- **codegraph (code structure):** for a code repo, the `codegraph` service indexes symbols/refs over
  the same corpus. See `docs/CODE-MEMORY.md`.

The invariant: **work is saved in `/work`; the index points at `/work`; recall stays fresh
automatically.** No manual re-index step in the agent's loop.

## Skills in the working folder

The runtime passes `--add-dir /work` to Claude Code, so the working folder is in scope for both file
access *and* **skill discovery**: any `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in the working tree (its root or
nested dirs up to its repo root) is discovered automatically, on top of the agent's own base skills in
`/agent/.claude/skills` (personal level). This gives a clean two-tier model:

- **Base skills** → `/agent/.claude/skills` — the agent's built-in capabilities (travel with the image/home).
- **Project skills** → `/work/.claude/skills` — the working tree's own skills, owned and versioned by
  that project. Symlinking them to a project skills repo (e.g. `../programs/<repo>/skills/<name>`) means
  a `git pull` in that repo refreshes the agent's skills with no copy step. Relative symlinks within the
  working tree resolve identically on the host and in the container.

Both tiers are available at once; on a same-`name:` collision Claude Code's documented precedence is
personal > project, so name your base and project skills distinctly (or use `skillOverrides` in
`settings.json` for per-skill control).
